<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's Old West music! It's a comedy show!&nbsp; It's a dinner theater! It's SHOWTIME UTAH! <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHOWTIME UTAH is the only entertainment venue of its kind in Utah and possibly in the entire nation, yet it is specifically designed for the Utah audience. Executive Producer Joan Peterson says she saw a genuine need for family-friendly live entertainment in Utah County and has spent much of the last year putting that idea into action. What she came up with is unique entertainment&nbsp;the entire year round. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three evenings are highlighted on Friday and Saturday night by the Old West Dinner Adventure, an Old West music and chuckwagon dinner extravaganza with music and comedy on the stage and even in the audience, because the servers are part of the show.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late night on the weekends you will find Utah County's Entertainment Hot Spot! There's comedy, karaoke, live bands, dancing and even a hypnotist every 4th Friday of the month. &nbsp;Watch the&nbsp;calendar page for more information.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every&nbsp;Thursday is All That Jazz.&nbsp; Join&nbsp;renoun Jazz pianist Fred McCray and vocalist Debra Bonner for an evening of New Orleans style Jazz, dancing and concessions.</p>
