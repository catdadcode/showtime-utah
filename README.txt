Note to new developers. This code has been optimized for functionality and in an easy to 
read fashion. Hopefully we at Chevtek Web Solutions will be the only ones to access this 
in the future, but in the event you have been hired to make changes to this site you can
contact us with any questions. Support@Chevtek.com or by phone (801) 669-6663.

If you are the website owner, I highly reccomend contacting us before making any changes to
the code for this site. One error can break the entire thing when dealing with dynamic web
design. If you need any changes we would be happy to implement them. We will fix any problems 
with the current product for free, but the code has been structured to accept new additions
should you decide you need something more. Hope you are enjoying your new site and with any
luck you won't ever have to see this note ;)

Have a great day!
