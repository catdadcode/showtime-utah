<p class="style3">It's  Old West music!&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a comedy show!&nbsp; It's a high-powered  variety night!&nbsp; It's a dinner theater!&nbsp; It's SHOWTIME UTAH!&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">SHOWTIME  UTAH is the only entertainment venue of its kind in Utah  and possibly in the entire nation, yet it is specifically designed for the Utah  audience.&nbsp; Executive Producer Joan Peterson says she saw a genuine need  for family-friendly live entertainment in Utah  County and has spent much of  the last year putting that idea into action.&nbsp; What she came up with is  unique: four different kinds of entertainment on&nbsp;three different nights  the entire year round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">The&nbsp;three  evenings are highlighted on Friday and Saturday night by the Old West Dinner  Adventure, an Old&nbsp;West music dinner extravaganza with music and comedy on  the stage and even in the audience, because the servers are part of the  show.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style3">Late night on the weekends you will find Utah County's Entertainment Hot Spot! There's comedy, karaoke, live bands, dancing and even a hypnotist every 4th Friday of the month. With the new dance floor installed, late nights will be devoted to dancing at least twice a month. Watch the schedule page for more information.</p>
<p class="style3">Monday  nights bring a whole different kind of show to the stage with Family Night  Live. This is specifically a variety show for and featuring children as well as  adults. You'll see a magcian, singers, dancers, jazz bands, and even Mark Twain makes an appearance now and then. The performers are first rate and the show is as professional as anything seen in our outside of Utah.</p>
<p class="style3">Founder  Joan Peterson has all the credentials necessary to put on a big-time  show.&nbsp; A former talent agent, she turned to movie casting and has been  involved in casting and script supervision in a number of films.&nbsp; She spent a year and a half as part of the casting team and overseeing the  extras-casting for the official LDS  Church film, “Joseph Smith:  Prophet of the Restoration.” Joan was also part of a two-person fund-raising  team which held a gala at The Venetian in Las  Vegas for the Rose Education Foundation, involving such  diverse talent as Pamela Anderson and J.C. Chassez of N'SYNC.&nbsp; She spent  all of last summer organizing an international philanthropic summit called  “Playing for Good” on the island of Mallorca  in the Mediterranean.&nbsp; It was hosted by  Eva Longoria, honored the Goldie Hawn Foundation, and was the first stop Paris  Hilton made after her highly publicized stint in jail. Joan can be heard every  Sunday on Clear Channel's KOSY 106.5 as the host of Sounds of the Sabbath.</p>
<p class="style3">She  has taken over The Grove Theater in Pleasant Grove and has transformed it into  a dinner theater which will draw on the almost unlimited talent of Utah.&nbsp;Whether  you choose to be a participant on stage or be entertained in the audience - one  or all of these shows is bound to entertain you.</p>
