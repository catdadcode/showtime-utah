    <p align="left" class="style7">Let  the audience be entertained by YOU!<br />
      In the old days it was the Ed Sullivan Show, today we see America's Got Talent,  but regardless of the era, the talented (and sometimes not so talented) have  always had the need and desire to find a way to perform, and there have always  been audiences ready and waiting to watch them. &nbsp;On the second Saturday of  every month we want to see all the amazing talents of Utah.<br />
      Utah has some wonderfully talented and entertaining people and it needs a venue  for those talents to be displayed and Showtime Utah has it! &nbsp;Beginners  Luck is all about giving the singer, dancer, juggler, yodeler, hypnotist,  karate kid (or adult) and every other kind of entertainer a chance to show Utah  what they've got. &nbsp;The next Kelly Clarkson or David Archuleta just might  be discovered here!<br />
  <br />
      On the 3rd Saturday of the month<br />
    <div align="left" class="style7">YOU ASKED FOR IT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- YOU GOT IT!<br />
      KARAOKE NIGHT!<br />
      So you're not Kelly Clarkson or David Archuleta, but you still love to sing,  and we would love to hear you!<br />
      Come to Showtime Utah's Karaoke night and sing your heart out to a very  positive and responsive audience.<br />
      Tell us you're coming and we'll make sure we have the song you want.<br />
&nbsp;Nights to be remembered for a very long time! </div>
