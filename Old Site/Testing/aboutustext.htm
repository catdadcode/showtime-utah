<p>It's  Old West music!&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a comedy show!&nbsp; It's a high-powered  variety night!&nbsp; It's a dinner theater!&nbsp; It's SHOWTIME UTAH!&nbsp; </p>
<p>SHOWTIME  UTAH is the only entertainment venue of its kind in Utah  and possibly in the entire nation, yet it is specifically designed for the Utah  audience.&nbsp; Executive Producer Joan Peterson says she saw a genuine need  for family friendly live entertainment in Utah  County and has spent much of  the last year putting that idea into action.&nbsp; What she came up with is  unique: four different kinds of entertainment on&nbsp;three different nights  the entire year round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The&nbsp;three  evenings are highlighted on Friday and Saturday night by the Old West Dinner  Adventure, an Old&nbsp;West music dinner extravaganza with music and comedy on  the stage and even in the audience because the servers are part of the  show.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Late night on the  weekends is anchored by the Entertainment Hot Spot on Friday's, an evening of  professional caliber musical talent from every genre'.</p>
<p>Late  night Saturday nights are a mixed bag of entertainment sure to please  everyone.&nbsp; The first Saturday is dedicated to comedy - It's&nbsp;Just For  Laughs&nbsp;is&nbsp;just what it says - It's just for laughs!&nbsp; And laugh  you will, even to the point of tears.&nbsp; The&nbsp;next two Saturday nights  are devoted to the Beginner's Luck show where anyone who can be entertaining in  any way can appear on stage with any sort of act.&nbsp; The&nbsp;evening is  open to anyone who can sing, dance, juggle, do magic, tell jokes, and generally  give an audience a good time.&nbsp; Peterson says she has even found a didgeridoo  player who wants to perform (that's a wooden instrument played by the  Australian Aborigines and at least one guy in Provo).&nbsp;&nbsp;  And you can't forget the movie goers - The last Saturday night is dedicated to  the Independent film maker who is just dying to get his work seen, and the  movie going public who are wanting to see the unique, different  and&nbsp;interesting films unseen anywhere else.</p>
<p>Monday  nights bring a whole different kind of show to the stage with Family Night  Live. This is specifically a variety show for and featuring children as well as  adults.&nbsp; It will be hosted by internationally known entertainer Alex Boye,  a Londoner whose boy band “Awesome” opened for the likes of N'SNYC and The  Backstreet Boys.&nbsp; He later moved to Utah  to sing gospel music and his music is familiar to fans of such movies as  Charly, The Dance, Baptist at the Barbeque, Suits on the Loose, and Church Ball  and featured on the Tabernacle Choir's new CD &quot;Showtime&quot; singing  Circle of Life.</p>
<p>Founder  Joan Peterson has all the credentials necessary to put on a big-time  show.&nbsp; A former talent agent, she turned to movie casting and has been  involved casting and script supervision in a number of films.&nbsp; She spent a year-and-a-half as part of the casting team and overseeing the  extras-casting for the official LDS  Church film, “Joseph Smith:  Prophet of the Restoration.” Joan was also part of a two-person fund-raising  team which held a gala at The Venetian in Las  Vegas for the Rose Education Foundation involving such  diverse talent as Pamela Anderson and J.C. Chassez of N'SYNC.&nbsp; She spent  all of last summer organizing an international philanthropic summit called  “Playing for Good,” on the island of Mallorca  in the Mediterranean.&nbsp; It was hosted by  Eva Longoria, honored the Goldie Hawn Foundation, and was the first stop Paris  Hilton made after her highly publicized stint in jail. Joan can be heard every  Sunday on Clear Channel's KOSY106.5 as the host of Sounds of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>She  has taken over The Grove Theater in Pleasant Grove and has transformed it into  a dinner theater which will draw on the almost unlimited talent of Utah.&nbsp;  Utah has the highest number of musical  instruments (even didgeridoos) per capita of any state in America.&nbsp;  When you add in the fact that there are two large universities within several  miles of The Grove, the access to accomplished talent is astonishing.  </p>
<p>Whether  you choose to be a participant on stage or be entertained in the audience - one  or all of these shows are bound to entertain you.</p>
